Support for this extension can be obtained from Signifyd: http://signifyd.com

In the case of errors, a log file can be generated and retrieved with the following steps:

1. Switch logging on:
1a) Navigate to the Magento admin panel
1b) Go to System->Configuration->Signifyd->Signifyd->Log Settings
1c) Ensure that all logging options are set to "Yes"
1d) Go to System->Configuration->Advanced->Developer->Log Settings
1e) Set the "Enabled" setting to "Yes"

Note that if the logs have only just been turned on, you may have to wait until some new orders have been processed in order to see entries in the logs.

2. Retrieve the log file via FTP (requires FTP access)
2a) The extension logs are now located at {magento-directory}/var/log/grep_signifyd.log
2b) Use a FTP client (e.g: https://filezilla-project.org/) to log in to your server and navigate to this folder
2c) Download the grep_signifyd.log file
